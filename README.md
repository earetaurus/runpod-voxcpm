## Usage Example 

```json
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Hello World"
  }
}
```


## Usage Example voice cloning

```json
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Hello World",
    "prompt_text": "the text spoken in the wav",
    "prompt_wav_url": "link to wav file use copyparty"
  }
}
```



## ⚠️ Important Warning - Voice Cloning Character Limit

**Voice cloning is recommended for texts longer than 1400 characters.**

Due to the model's 1500 character limit, this implementation chunks longer texts into 1400-character segments. However, VoxCPM currently does not support seed values, which means:

- **Voice inconsistency**: Each chunk may have slightly different voice characteristics
- **Audio artifacts**: You may notice variations in tone, pitch, or speaking style between segments
- **Reduced quality**: The overall voice cloning quality may be compromised for very long texts

**Recommendation**: For best results with voice cloning, keep your input text under 1400 characters or be prepared for potential voice inconsistencies in longer outputs.

This repository contains a serverless implementation of VoxCPM designed to run on RunPod. It allows for text-to-speech synthesis using the VoxCPM model.

## Features

*   **Serverless Architecture**: Deployable on RunPod serverless for scalable audio generation.
*   **VoxCPM Integration**: Leverages the VoxCPM model for high-quality speech synthesis.
